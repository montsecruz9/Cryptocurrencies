# Cryptocurrencies
The purpose of this analysis is to discover any trends in a cryptocurrency dataset using unsupervised learning machine. Analyzing this dataset helps us see grouped cryptocurrencies on the trading market and create a classification system for an investment portfolio.

The data was preprocessed to fit the machine learning models. Dimensions were reduced using the PCA algorithm. 
The data was then clustered using the K-Means algorithm. The value for K was predicted using the elbow curve (k=4).
To visualize the results, a 3D scatter plot was created. The data was scaled again and plotted in a 2D scatter plot: Total Coins Mined vs. Total Coins Supply.
